# moustache-wax
Audit your ``{{ tags }}`` for consistent whitespace.
___
Your development team may prefer fluffy `{{ tomSelleck }}` moustaches that breathe with whitespace.  You may have decided as a team that you prefer narrow `{{charlieChaplin}}` moustaches.  Chances are, you'd like them to be consistent throughout your codebase.

This project aims to eventually become an automated tool for linting HTML. Development teams that have decided to take a consistent approach to whitespace surrounding databinding tags, i.e., `{{ moustaches }}` or `{{ handlebars }}`, will eventually be able to include it as part of their linting automated testing suite.

This project is a work in progress.  It may lay here in my ~~ideas graveyard~~ GitHub profile untouched for a while, or it may turn into something viable.  Feel free to submit a PR or issue.  I'd love to hear your thoughts.

### Moustache Wax
_From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia_

Moustache wax is a stiff pomade applied to a moustache as a grooming aid to hold the hairs in place, especially at the extremities. The required product strength (or stiffness) is based on whisker length and the desired style. It can also have restorative properties, which become more important as the hair length increases.
